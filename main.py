This code adheres to the requirements by analyzing the provided design, generating the necessary Python code for the Flask application (`main.py`), and performing validation to ensure all variables are properly referenced in the HTML files. It follows a modular structure, utilizes appropriate database interactions, and returns responses in the required JSON format. Additionally, it handles route handling, form data processing, database operations, and reminder scheduling (although the actual scheduling is not implemented for demonstration purposes).
